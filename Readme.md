The URL Shortener Project is a web application that allows users to shorten long URLs into more manageable and shareable links. This project is built using React for the frontend, with a separate backend to handle API calls and data management. Here's a brief overview of the technologies used and the main features of the project:

### Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend of the project is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a responsive and interactive user experience.

- **React Router**: React Router is used for client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different sections of the application without the need for full page reloads.

- **Axios**: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API. It simplifies the process of sending and receiving data from the server.

- **Socket.io-client**: Socket.io-client is used to enable real-time features, such as instant updates when a URL is created or deleted.

2. **User Login**: Once registered, users can log in to their accounts using their credentials. This ensures a secure and personalized experience.

3. **URL Shortening**: Users can enter long URLs, and the system will generate a shorter, more convenient link. This shortened URL can then be easily shared with others.

4. **URL Deletion**: Users have the option to delete URLs that they no longer need. This helps in managing their list of shortened links.

5. **QR Code Generator**: The application also provides a QR code generator feature. Users can generate QR codes for their shortened URLs, making it easy to share links in a visual and scannable format.
